# Lighthouse Performance Testing
* Make sure all logging is set to false in config.js
* If you have a choice, use the API server instead of a local instance

In general the goal is to make the main chunk as small as possible, any other chunks beyond what is
automatically generated by WebPack don't save much runtime, and greatly slow down compile time.

Be sure to label any new chunks you make via lazy loading...
```
const DelayedLoad = React.lazy(() => import(/* webpackChunkName: 'DelayedLoad' */ '../../components/Widgets/DelayedLoad'));
```
Make a minimum sized build using the "build" script.  Keep in mind that the "prod" script will
decrease the size of the chunks by about 2/3.

```
npm run build
node server-prod-local.js
```
